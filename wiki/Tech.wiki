# Brainstorm of technologies

= Introduction =

We're planning on implementing large tech trees for this game. We'd like to pool everyone's logic and imagination. Please comment below if you have any ideas. We'd rather have lots of ideas to pick from than not enough.

       * the German's "Sun Gun"

       * Rods from God

       * Boarding Parties
         * manned
         * unmanned

*Armor*

     _technology to keep from being hurt_

       * Point Defense
         * Lasers
         * Flak Cannons (space shotguns...)

       * Gun jammer

*Engines/mobility*

     _technology to move_

       * Warp Drive

       * Wormhole Device

       * In*system FTL drive

       * Ion drives

       * Interdiction Device

       * Solar Sails

       * Magnetic Manipulation
         * Attracts or repulses a planet's or star's magnetic field


*Support*

       * communication

       * power management

       * sensors

       * mining

       * robotics
         * unmanned defense points
           * turrets
           * vs. boarding parties
         * allows for more dangerous environments on ship
           * lax radiation protocols
           * could use combo of robots and environment to repel boarders

         * Ship/Combat Scanners
           * Use for 
             * projectile detection
             * scanning ship for weaknesses
               * Possibly player designated targets on hull blueprint
