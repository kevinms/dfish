#summary Howto compile dfish with sound support!

= Dependencies =

In order to have sound in dfish SDL_mixer needs to be installed. Go to http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ and download:

{{{
# 32-bit
SDL_mixer-1.2.11-1.i586.rpm
SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-1.i586.rpm
}}}

or

{{{
# 64-bit
SDL_mixer-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm
SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm
}}}

If you need a debian package just use the alien command:

{{{
sudo alien -d SDL_mixer-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm 
sudo alien -d SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm
}}}

Now just use your package manager and install the package!

= Compiling dfish =

To compile dfish run:

{{{
make clean
make SND=1
}}}

Enjoy the music :)

= Sound Commands =

There are three commands which control sound in dfish

{{{
/snd-volume VOLUME (percent) - Set music volume
/snd-stop - Stop music
/snd-play music filename (no spaces) - Play specific music file
}}}

You can play any music you would like simply by providing the path to the music file, for example:

{{{
/snd-play /usr/home/alice/favoritesong.mp3
}}}

By default the music will play in a loop forever.
