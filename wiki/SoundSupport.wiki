In order to have sound in dfish SDL_mixer needs to be installed. Go to http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ and download:

{{{
# 32-bit
SDL_mixer-1.2.11-1.i586.rpm
SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-1.i586.rpm
}}}

or

{{{
# 64-bit
SDL_mixer-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm
SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm
}}}

If you need a debian package just use the alien command:

{{{
sudo alien -d SDL_mixer-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm 
sudo alien -d SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-1.x86_64.rpm
}}}

Now just use your package manager and install the package!
