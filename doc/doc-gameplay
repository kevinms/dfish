Core Game Objectives
--------------------
1) Massive Configurablility with:
	A) Shuttles
	B) Weaponry
	C) Traps
2) Massive scope of a UNIVERSE
	A) Worm holes
	B) Singularities
	C) Asteriod fields
3) Interaction with other players
	A) Human
	B) AI
4) Time passes MUCH faster in game so astronomical events can occur

Base Game Ideas
---------------
1) Multiplayer
	A) each players orbits their own planet
	B) only when a player is close enough to a neighboring planet should
	   the server begin to send information about another players station
	C) possible algorithms to be used will be dijkstra's for finding the
	   shortest possible path, and kd-trees could be used to determine
	   collisions.  Although this possibly will all be done with path
	   finding.
2) 'pending' doom durring the building of their space station.
	A) Their light source could implode
	B) Comets and meteors.
	C) Aliens!! (could come in peace ;) (lost or stranded aliens that need to phone home)
	D) Black holes, White holes
	E) Singularities
3) Material Gathering
	INTERSTELLAR MATTER a.k.a. ISM (wiki it)
	A) Set off on the journey with a momentarily self sustaining space shuttle
	B) Space debris
	C) Satelites
	D) Trips to the planet
	E) Trips to the N moon(s)
	F) Trips to neighboring planets in the galaxy
4) Space/Time Travel
	A) Worm holes can be used to travel between galaxies.
		I) actually moving entire stations to your enimies galaxy
	B) Shuttles of varing complexities can be constructed for a variaty of missions
	   This is a good place to get creative.  You could build a massive fleet of 
	   self sustaining star cruisers and invade another galaxy.
	C) As for random plots and scenerios, some ideas could be pulled from star trek.
