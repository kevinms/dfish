DFISH - The Game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each player starts around a planet
You can build and customize a starbase
	be a fort and a shipyard all in one

Planet has research, resource gathering, econ??, and gov't??

~Research has 3~4 main categories: armor, weapons, support stuff, and engines
	research discoveries are dependent on your currently available resources
		(what scientists have to tinker with...)
	
	
Production of ships should be limited to a handful of ships per player
	Use rarity of resources to manage the number of ships produced and the types
	Cooler ships should be dependent on even rarer resources
	allow different tech trees to be based around different config's of resources
		ship/tech development should be dependent on the resources available
		The ADAPTABLE player should be the one that wins the game
			the one that can use the hand of resources dealt to him and make the best stuff
	
Purpose of ship combat is to have a zoomed-in view so that the player can see
	the coolness of the ships he and the other players have designed
The ships are going to be BIG
