kevin4-pbwafer

This branch contains the new engine dfish will begin using.  It is in a really
early developement stage so this branch was created to work on the engine
without messing up all the working code we have in the trunk.

This branch will be merged when at least the window and input systems are
in working condition.  Soon to follow will be the menu system.

Bellow are a couple things that I want to complete in the near future:

pbwafer - debug macros     [          ]  0/10

pbwafer - window system    [#######   ]  7/10
pbwafer - input            [##        ]  2/10
pbwafer - menu             [#         ]  1/10

pbwafer - buffer i/o       [########  ]  8/10
pbwafer - udp net library  [          ]  0/10
pbwafer - protocol         [          ]  0/10
pbwafer - huffman compress [          ]  0/10

pbwafer - blueprints       [          ]  0/10
pbwafer - blueprint diff   [          ]  0/10
pbwafer - physics          [          ]  0/10
