1) The closest star to the Sun is only 7000 times further than the edge of our solar system. This map shows all of the stellar systems that lie within 12.5 light years from us.
2) A large proportion of the stars visible with the naked eye are within 250 light years. This map shows this tiny section of our galaxy that surrounds our Sun.

(The mnemonic "Oh, be a fine girl /guy, kiss me" is sometimes used.)

The spectral classes O through M are subdivided by Arabic numerals (0â€“9)
For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in the A class and A9 denotes
the coolest ones. The Sun is classified as G2.

Hottest - Coolest
O, B, A, F, G, K and M

O stars "blue"
B stars "blue-white"
A stars "white"
F stars "yellow-white"
G stars "yellow"
K stars "orange"
M stars "red"


==============
   O stars
==============
Planetary formation around an O star will quickly undergo photoevaporation

Photoevaporation denotes the process when a planet is stripped of its
atmosphere (or parts of the atmosphere) due to high energy photons and
other electromagnetic radiation.

O-stars shine with a power over a million times our Sun's output

==============
   B stars
==============
As O and B stars are so powerful, they only live for a very short time,
and thus they do not stray far from the area in which they were formed.
These stars tend to cluster together in what are called OB associations,
which are associated with giant molecular clouds. 

==============
   A stars
==============
Class A stars are amongst the more common naked eye stars, and are white or bluish-white.
About 1 in 160 of the main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are Class A stars.

==============
   F stars
==============
Their color is white. About 1 in 33 of the main sequence stars in the 
solar neighborhood are Class F stars.

==============
   G stars
==============
Class G stars are probably the best known, if only for the reason that
our Sun is of this class. About 1 in 13 of the main sequence stars in
the solar neighborhood are Class G stars.

Supergiant stars often swing between O or B (blue) and K or M (red). 
While they do this, they do not stay for long in the G classification
as this is an extremely unstable place for a supergiant to be.

==============
   K stars
==============
Class K are orangish stars which are slightly cooler than our Sun. Some
K stars are giants and supergiants, such as Arcturus, while orange
dwarfs, like Alpha Centauri B, are main sequence stars.

About 1 in 8 of the main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are 
Class K stars. There is a suggestion that K Spectrum stars are very well
suited for life.

==============
   M stars
==============
Class M is by far the most common class. About 76% of the main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are Class M stars.

Although most Class M stars are red dwarfs, the class also hosts most giants and some supergiants
