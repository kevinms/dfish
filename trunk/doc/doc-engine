=====================
     Engine Doc
=====================

5 frames per second where each frame thousands of calculations will take place.
Planets will be orbiting around their stars.
Depending on the type of object it may affect its surrounds as well (singularity)
Gravity will affect all things to an extent.
	1) if food is on a tile by itself in space gravity will be calculated for it
	2) if food is on a tile that is part of a ship then the ships mass
	   will need to be calculated and gravity will be applied appropriately
	3) things in space will obay newtons laws of conservation

*** If this engine developes enough it may be possible for a civilization
	to build planet sized cruisers or possibly even planets.  Therefore,
	the new object may be large enough to actually noticably affect 
	surrounding asteriods, planets, even stars!!

//NOTE: If planet orbits are the only things that actually change other
than player generated objects then how will it look in the game
1) how fast will the planets orbit
2) depending on the view you are in 


Model
	1) Calculations
		A) Planet orbits - calculate every N frame to reduce the # of calculations
		B) 

View
	1) Will be built around 'sectors'
	2) Because I would like this game to be able to scale to epic porportions
	3) There will be a star gazer (map viewer) in the game.
		A) Galaxy View
		B) Star View
		C) Planet View
		D) Cruiser View
	4) Each view will be made up of N sectors
	5) The menu (or hotkeys) will let you either zoom in on a sector 
	   or perform actions on objects in that sector
	6) Objects will be constantly in motion so the need for a 'pin view'
	   option is great.  Pinning the view to an object will center that
	   object on the screen. For example a planet will be centered on
	   screen in planet view.  And a space man or cruiser will be centered
	   on the screen in cruiser mode.
	
Controller
	1) Will basically be an input handler.
	2) The controller will call for view and model updates when needed.
	3) 

Server
	1) will appropriately distrubute the civilizations in the beginning

Galaxy Editor
	1) Let the user change practically ALL variables in the game to their liking
	2) Let them build whatever they would like by giving them a gigantic listing
	   of items that can be spawned automagically

Scripting Language
	1) Be able to write scripts to preform different actions in the game.
	2) Make a script that can control your troops
	3) Make a script that will wait till a scout sees an enemy then runs
	   to the laser and attempts to defend the cruiser
	4) Write a script to calculate the trajectory of an incomming missle
	   accurately shoot it down
	5) should it be python/lua/etc?  Maybe even lisp?
	6) Somehow let the user build their own machinery!  Possibly let
	   them upload parts.
	7) if there were some way of letting the users write their own physics
	   functions for their new objects then they could practically create
	   anything.

Default Resource Files
	1) Will hold all the items that can be used in the game.
	2) Let the user be able to add their own concepts into the game.

Electronic Parts
	1) Multiple types of rockets all with variables that may be changed
	2) Have a 'weld' option to weld parts to another object.
	3) Solar Panels for energy
	4) Lasers, gravity bomb, traps, programmable lasers, lcd screen for 
	   displaying information.  each item could return output each frame
	   and the lcd could be 'wired' to the item.
	5) Programmable rocket trajectories.  Release the payload as a bundle
	   then durring its flight have them break apart and target different
	   enemies.
	6) Defensive parts will be needed.  Truthfully this seems a little
	   like an rts now.... accept for the fact the user builds whatever
	   they want.

// Spring 2010 semester will bring about these
*** Networking needs to be implmented as well!
*** Optimization through inline assembly

Base Game Physics
-----------------
1) Orbital patterns around a planet.
	A) These orbits will need to be micromanaged to maintain orbit and
	   not fly off into space or crash into the planet.
	B) 
2) Gravity will only be an issue when you are close enough to a planet for it to matter.
	A) Space Men/Women will actually float off into space if they are not 
	   tethered to the shuttle/station.
	B) There will be a random factor to the tether breaking.
3) Air
	A) oxygen producing plants.
	B) air tanks to hold a specific amount of air.
	C) if the shuttle/station has a whole then the vacumm of space so 
	   correctly effect the shuttle/station.
	D) this imposses the need for air locks and emergency protocols.
4) Weoponry
	A) A myriad of weapons can be designed in MANY different ways.
	B) Much more detail here.
5) Energy
	A) Solar Power!
	B) Generators
	C) Feed off of converting mass to pure energy
